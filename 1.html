<h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2><p><a href=" https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Makrup Language(HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong> creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications. Arguably one of the toughest exams in the world, Korea’s College Scholastic Ability Test, commonly known as the Suneung, has played a pivotal role for decades in measuring students’ potential achievement in the future after enrolling in college and determining students’ learning abilities after 12 years of schooling. The exam was first introduced in 1994 to replace the College Entrance Strength Test in response to criticism that it focused too much on rote memorization rather than problem-solving.

The eight-hour exam administered in November tests students in the areas of Korean, mathematics, English, Korean history, a second foreign language or Chinese characters and “exploration” subjects such as social studies, science or vocation.</p>
